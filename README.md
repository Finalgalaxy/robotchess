# robotchess
Java-based 2D robot chess game.

The graphics is done through overriding Swing paintComponent(Graphics g) component.
It is a playable chess game with RobotWarriors and RobotWorkers, made from scratch, pure Java language.

Functionalities:
- Graphic style (Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/martaceliento" target="_blank">Marta Benedetta Celiento</a>, very glad)
- Dynamic robot selection (MouseListener on grid generated in runtime, obfuscation of other graphic components)
- Supports map editing (through editing level fights)
- Supports quicksaves
- Local multiplayer 1v1! 
- AI for other robots (You can only control 1 robot at time; others will act based on AI settings)

Have fun!
